                            <p>The terms of The DAO Creation are set forth in the smart contract code existing on the Ethereum blockchain at [address]. Nothing in this explanation of terms or in any other document or communication may modify or add any additional obligations or guarantees beyond those set forth in The DAO’s code. Any and all explanatory terms or descriptions are merely offered for educational purposes and do not supercede or modify the express terms of The DAO’s code set forth on the blockchain; to the extent you believe there to be any conflict or discrepancy between the descriptions offered here and the functionality of The DAO’s code at [address], The DAO’s code controls and sets forth all terms of The DAO Creation. </p>

                            <p><strong class="color-black">Important Disclaimer: DAO tokens do not represent or constitute an equity ownership stake, share, or equivalent in ANY public or private company, corporation, or other legal entity in any jurisdiction; DAO tokens are only for use in connection with The DAO under the terms of The DAO’s smart contract code and do not entitle any holder of DAO tokens to any additional rights with respect to any other corporation, company, or legal entity in any jurisdiction.</strong></p>

                            <p>When you click the “I Accept” button or check box presented with the terms you are agreeing that you are taking part in The DAO’s Creation under the terms set forth in The DAO’s smart contract code at your own risk. If you are entering into The DAO’s Creation Phase for another entity or any third-party, such as the company you work for, you represent to The DAO, you warrant that you have legal authority to bind that entity to these terms as set forth in The DAO’s smart contract code.</p>

                            <p>By Creating DAO tokens through interaction with The DAO’s smart contract code, you expressly agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth in that code. If you do not understand or do not agree to those terms, you should not Create DAO tokens.</p>

                            <p>The use of The DAO’s smart contract code and the Creation of DAO tokens carries significant financial risk, including using  experimental software. This document does not constitute a Prospectus of any sort, is not a solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any jurisdiction.</p>

The software code currently available at [address] is the sole source for the terms under which DAO tokens may be created.</p>

                            <ul class="icon-list mb25">

                            <p>You further agree to accept sole risk for the Creation of DAO tokens.

                            <h3 class="color-dark pt25">Risks</h3>

                            <p>The Creation of DAO tokens carries with it significant risk. Prior to Creating  DAO tokens, carefully consider the exemplary and non-exhaustive list of risks set forth below and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax professionals prior to Creating DAO tokens.</p>


                            <p><strong>1. Risk of Security Weaknesses in The DAO’s Software</strong></p>


                            <p>The DAO concept is both experimental in nature and unproven. There is a risk that, as an open source project, any contributor to The DAO’s software could introduce weaknesses or bugs into the DAO software, causing the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder’s accounts.</p> 



                            <p><strong>2. Risk of Weakness in the DAO underlying blockchain, and/or Ethereum Network</strong></p>

                            <p>The DAO software is itself based on an unproven platform: the Ethereum blockchain. There is a risk that, as an open source project, any contributor to the Ethereum blockchain could introduce weaknesses or bugs into the Ethereum software, causing the loss of  DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder’s accounts.</p> 



                            <p><strong>3. Risk of unforeseen attack vectors</strong></p>

                            <p>The field of Digital Cryptography is very new and for this reason, there is a risk of unforeseen attack both in terms of the underlying cryptographic protocol that back the functioning of the DAO as well as 'game theory' related vectors which have not been documented to date. Both these vectors represent a risk that could lead the loss of DAO tokens or ETH in one or more or even all of the DAO Token Holder’s accounts. </p>



                            <p><strong>4. Regulatory risks</strong></p>

                            <p>Blockchain technology and Ethereum are allowing new forms of interactions between individuals and/or companies, some of them are still to be imagined and implemented. Like with the appearance of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, it is very likely that specific regulations will be set in different jurisdictions targeting blockchain technology and more specifically DAOs. These regulations may or may not be DAO friendly and some might even forbid any relationships between an individual or company and a DAO.</p>





                            <h3 class="color-dark pt25">Taxation</h3>
                                                    
                            <p>No party involved with the Creation of The DAO makes any representations concerning the tax implications of the Creation of DAO tokens or the possession or use of DAO tokens. You bear the sole responsibility to determine if the Creation of DAO tokens or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of DAO tokens over time has tax implications for you in your home jurisdiction.</p>
                                                    
                            <p>You  Create DAO tokens with your own actions. To the extent permitted by law,  Third Parties or Individuals associated with the Creation of The DAO are not liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the Creation of DAO tokens. </p>
                                            

                            
                            <h3 class="color-dark pt25">Forward looking statements</h3>

                            <p>This document contains statements that are, or may be deemed to be, “forward looking statements” which are prospective in nature. These forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking terminology, or the negative thereof such as “outlook”, "plans", "expects" or "does not expect", "is expected", "continues", "assumes", "is subject to", "budget", "scheduled", "estimates", "aims", "forecasts", "risks", "intends", "positioned", "predicts", "anticipates" or "does not anticipate", or "believes", or variations of such words or comparable terminology and phrases or statements that certain actions, events or results "may", "could", "should", “shall”, "would", "might" or "will" be taken, occur or be achieved. Such statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations. Forward-looking statements are not based on historical facts, but rather on current predictions, expectations, beliefs, opinions, plans, objectives, goals, intentions and projections about future events, results of operations, prospects, financial condition and discussions of strategy. By their nature, forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond anyone's control.</p>

                            <p>Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and may and often do differ materially from actual results. Important factors that could cause these uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the “Risks and uncertainties” of this document. None of the third parties provide any representation, assurance or guarantee that the occurrence of the events expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements in this document will actually occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements which only speak as of the date of this document. All third  parties involved with the DAO Creation and their affiliates expressly disclaim any intention, obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The making of this document does not constitute a recommendation regarding any securities.</p>
